# dev [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cloudposse/dev.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cloudposse/dev) [![Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/cloudposse/dev.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/cloudposse/dev/releases) [![Slack Community](https://slack.cloudposse.com/badge.svg)](https://slack.cloudposse.com)


This development harness creates a [monorepo](https://docs.cloudposse.com/glossary/monorepo/) experience for a [polyrepo](https://docs.cloudposse.com/glossary/polyrepo/) architecture by leveraging [git submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules).

## Dependencies

* [OSX Developer Tools, Homebrew, Docker for Mac](https://docs.cloudposse.com/local-dev-environments/quickstart/)
* [aws-vault](https://docs.cloudposse.com/tools/aws-vault/) for logging into AWS
* [chamber](https://docs.cloudposse.com/tools/chamber/) for accessing development secrets

This project is part of our comprehensive ["SweetOps"](https://docs.cloudposse.com) approach towards DevOps. 


It's 100% Open Source and licensed under the [APACHE2](LICENSE).





## Quick Start

Clone [this repo](https://github.com/cloudposse/dev/) recursively:

```
git clone --recursive git@github.com:cloudposse/dev.git
```

Initialize the [`build-harness`](https://github.com/cloudposse/build-harness):

```
make init
```

Install native dependencies (e.g. `chamber` and `aws-vault`)

```
make deps
```

Update current submodules in `projects/` folder to `@HEAD`

```
make git/update
```

List available `make` targets

```
make help
```

Bring up a complete environment: (*without* secrets)

```
make compose/up
```

Bring up a complete environment: (*with* secrets)

```
aws-vault exec cp-dev-admin -- chamber exec local -- make compose/up
```

**NOTE**: `local` represents a secrets service namespace. Multiple namespaces can be specified. 

Destroy current environment:

```
make compose/down
```

## Submodules

Add a new submodule:

```
git submodule add git@github.com:cloudposse/example.git projects/example/
```

Initialize a module (e.g. after calling `git submodule add`):

```
git -C projects/example/ submodule update --init
```
